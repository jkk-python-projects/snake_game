# Snake Game

This repository contains a Python practice project to create a game of snake.

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake's own body.

The project is implemented in Python and uses the turtle library for graphics and user input handling. It provides a simple and interactive gameplay experience, allowing players to control the snake using arrow keys and keeping track of their score.

## Features

- Classic snake game mechanics.
- Player-controlled snake movement.
- Randomly generated food.
- Collision detection with boundaries and self.
- Score tracking and display.
- Game over condition.

## Usage

To play the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/jkk-python-projects/snake_game.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   cd snake_game

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install turtle

4. Run the Python script:
   python main.py

The game window will open, and you can control the snake using the arrow keys. Eat the food to grow longer and try to avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake itself. The score will be displayed at the top of the screen, and the game will end when the snake collides with an obstacle.

5. Press the "Esc" key to exit the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle library
